    <h2>Discription</h2>
        <p>churro, a fritter of Spanish origin made of flour-based batter that is piped into
           extremely hot fat and fried, then rolled in cinnamon-laced sugar, resulting in a
           treat that is sweet and crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Combine water, 2 Â½ tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in
                 a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from
                  the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</li>
            <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
            <li> Transfer dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully
                 pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so
                you don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to
                transfer churros to paper towels to drain. </li>
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture. </li>
        </ol>
